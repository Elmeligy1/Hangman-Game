## Features

- Randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
- Displays the current state of the word with guessed letters and underscores.
- Provides a drawing of the hangman that updates with each incorrect guess.
- Allows players to guess letters until they either guess the word or exceed the maximum number of incorrect guesses.
